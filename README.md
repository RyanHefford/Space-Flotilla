# Space-Flotilla
 
Instructions On How to PLay:

- WASD keys: Player Ship Movement
- Left click: Player Ship Shoot
- Space: Player Ship Laser (following power pickup)

Objective:

Swarms of Alien ships (red) will damage the player on contact, 
so avoid taking damage at all costs. Small ships will continue to
respawn, so keep on your toes and keep moving and shooting.
Special Overlord ships (pink) take more shots to kill, and can
command smaller ships to suicide bombard attack the player in an
attempt to chunk their health down, so focus fire the quick bombarding
ships first to preserve your health. Small alien ships have a chance
to drop a powerup for the player, allowing for a powerful laser
beam attack. When gunned down, Overlords will respawn via small alien
ship sacrifices from the corners of the map. Last as long as possible
and get your best score!

Extra Scene: 'Pathfinding' scene which is meant to show the Path Smoothing functionality. Details on how to use it is in the report.

Quick note: in case you open the project and you see a lot of compiler errors, this is because I use a mac and everyone in the group uses Windows so the way to get rid of those issues is by going to the project folder and deleting the Library folder and opening the project again. This will fix it as Unity automatically generates that folder and will ensure the meta files matches the OS you are using :). Also our main scene is called "BasicScene"
